                    Think about how you get information, listen to music, watch shows, or talk to your friends. All of these actions involve media. Simply put, media refers to any means of communication that delivers information or experiences to an audience. It's the 'how' messages travel from a sender to a receiver. The word "medium" (singular) refers to one specific way of communicating, like a newspaper or a radio. "Media" (plural) is the broader term for all these different ways combined. From a handwritten letter to a live-streamed concert, if it carries a message, it's media.
                    Understanding this basic definition is the first step to becoming a smart consumer of information. It helps you recognize the countless ways messages reach you every day.
